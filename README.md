# Muksumuistio

## Description

This is a simple application for a daycare center to mark whether a child is present or not. In the application, you can add a new child, edit the current name or delete it. When you tap a child's name in the list, its background turns green, indicating that the child is present. A second tap changes the color to orange, indicating that the child is not present. The total number of children present is displayed at the top of the screen.
